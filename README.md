The goal of this project is to create a digital version of the popular board game Battleship. All visuals are designed for the terminal through ASCII visuals. The player will control their ship placement with W,A,S,D and with the same controls, make their guesses in the fog of war. There are 5 ship types – Carrier, Battleship, Cruiser, Submarine, and Destroyer – which are placed on a 10 x 10 grid where both players will try to make a strike to destroy all five ships. Scope: Two player and Single Player, terminal based, standard C libraries, not graphical
